/**
 * Reports that an image inside `node` could not be decoded.
 *
 * The obvious place for this is an `onerror` handler on the `<img>` itself,
 * and that is what breaks. Svelte's server renderer stamps
 * `onload="this.__e=event"` and `onerror="this.__e=event"` onto any `<img>`,
 * `<iframe>`, `<link>` or `<script>` carrying an `onload`/`onerror` handler, a
 * spread or a `use:` directive, so events that fire before hydration can be
 * replayed afterwards. Consumers serve this kit under a `script-src` policy
 * with a nonce and no `unsafe-inline`, and a nonce never covers an event
 * handler attribute, so the browser blocks that snippet and logs a violation
 * for every element it rendered. Hydration then strips the attributes, which
 * is why the markup looks innocent by the time anyone inspects it.
 *
 * Attaching from a wrapper element keeps the `<img>` free of all three, so the
 * server sends no inline handler at all. `error` does not bubble, hence the
 * capture phase, and an image that already failed fires nothing more, so its
 * settled state is read once on attach.
